//** STUDENTS AND AP GRADERS - This is the section where you should provide credit for all resources ( ie 
//** images & sound files) used in your game.  GRADERS, as the teacher I have provided a template as well as
//** a game library ( referenced above ) as a starting point, but the student's game design, functions,
//** algorithms, and abstrctions are theirs unless otherwise noted
//** IMAGES - Image Name                  URL or Other Source          Credit Given
//**
//** SOUNDS - Sound Name                  URL or Other Source          Credit Given
    
//*********************************************Game Functions **********************************************
// functions STUDENT written that are unique to your game.  Best to list alphabetically.
// If you had any assistance developing any of these functions please provide appropriate credit above the
// function itself

//***********************************************************************************************************
//*** Event handlers
//*** The following event handlers are written to use functions built
//*** intop the game library.  As such, the default event handlers are TEACHER written.  However, student will
//*** write all code that utlizes these event handlers - in Step #1 within the draw loop
//*** If you want them to work differently than the library simply replace them with your own.  
//*** By default the key handlers keep track of each key (unique names defined for each) //*** marking them 
//*** as either true if pressed or false if not pressed
    function keyDownHandler(e) {
          myKeys.processDownKey(e);
    }
    function keyUpHandler(e) {
        myKeys.processUpKey(e);
    }
    
//*** The default mouse handlers are TEACHER written 
//*** the mouse handlers keep track of both WHERE the mouse is at all times AND if any of the buttons is 
//*** currenly pressed or not
    function mouseMoveHandler(e) {
        myKeys.processMouseMove(e);
    }
    function mouseUpHandler(e) {
        myKeys.processMouseUp(e);
    }
    function mouseDownHandler(e) {
        myKeys.processMouseDown(e);
    }
    
//**********************Main draw function **************************
//This is really the code that is run EVERY TIME we do a screen
//refresh - unless otherwise noted this is STUDENT code
//*******************************************************************
       function draw() {        
        //***  STEP #1 Process any keystrokes / mouse movements
        //*** If you have any Automated movements by your computer
        //** "adversaries" I'd place that logic here too
        //Process clicks - just checking the status of any keys I'm interested in
   
        if (myKeys.rightArrow) {
            
        }
 
    //******************** STEP #2 Any game logic ***********************
           
           
    //************* STEP #3 Draw all game objects on teh screen *********

    //FIRST Clear the Screen to prepare for a repaint   
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
           
   //First draw the background image

   //Now draw any ACTIVE images

    game.gameIterate();//Teacher provided code - required for game library to work properly
    requestAnimationFrame(draw); //Teacher provided code - Keep this line as it is required for a fluid repaining of the canvas    
}

//**************************************************************************************
// *********************** Begin Main portion of program *******************************
//**************************************************************************************
//** You can actually think of this as the initialization phase of the program.  This is
//** where you first load your images and create any variables you'll use throughout the
//** rest of the program.
//** ALL of this code is teacher provided and should not be changed.  Student code should
//** go in STUDENT SECTION marked below
//** Because this code is NOT in a function, it is the first thing to run and only runs 
//** ONCE.  The very last thing this code does is call our game loop ( which is the 
//** draw() funciton
//***************************************************************************************

//**DO NOT remove these two variables.  
//**They are what help us "reference" the canvas and "paint" on it
    var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
    var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

    //Variables that determine how fast (and if) the background moves.  If the background
    //does NOT move set both to 0 - this is the default;
    //game.bgDX = -1;
    //game.bgDY = 0;
    
    //Defining the EVENT LISTENERS - looks for any keybord key being pressed and released
    //Note that it is in these EventHandler functions that you actually capture WHICH key was pressed or released.  For each key you
    //are interested in you then perform specific actions.  In the approach I have here we are simply indicating if the key is pressed or
    //not by changing the related keypressed variable to true or false.  Then we take actions later based on these variables

    document.addEventListener("keydown", keyDownHandler, false);
    document.addEventListener("keyup", keyUpHandler, false);
    document.addEventListener("mousemove", mouseMoveHandler, false);
    document.addEventListener("mousedown", mouseDownHandler, false);
    document.addEventListener("mouseup", mouseUpHandler, false);
    // Create the game Object - Always have this declared as it has
    //important properies other areas depend upon
    var game = new GameMaster();
    // Object that holds all keypress and release data   
    var myKeys = new KeysPresses(); 
    
    //****************STUDENT INITIALIZATION CODE SECTION ****************
    // ************* Loading/creating your characters, background,
    // ***  and terrain.  This is all what I would call "pre-processing
    // *** Kind of all the setup work that must occur BEFORE we actually
    // *** get into our game loop
    // ******************************************************************

    //****************************** Final Image Load Section ****************
    //** OK - this is odd, but there is a reason for this...
    //** images can take a while to load - at least in computer time, so
    //** we want to make sure they have all loaded BEFORE, we actually 
    //** start the game. For this reason we don't call the draw() function
    //** ( which is our game loop) until the last image has loaded.  
    //** The onload is an event is triggered when the last image variable 
    //** imgPacman is actually loaded.  At that point we know it is safe call 
    //** the draw() function - which starts our gameloop
    //** **********************************************************************
    var lastImage = new Image();
    lastImage.src = game.imageDir + "imageName.png";
    lastImage.onload = function() {
        //** put the image in the appropriate Sprite/Spritesheet
        draw(); //This calls the draw() function - which is our game loop
    };
